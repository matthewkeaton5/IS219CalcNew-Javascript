Descriptive Statistics functions
Descriptive Statistics test functions
Statistics Model

Program Requirements
1.	Use random data for tests and be able to increase the number of calculations required i.e. be able to increase the list of numbers that the mean calculation is done on.  You can actually use built in libraries or 3rd party libraries to check your calculations that you complete yourself.  i.e. you can use the standard deviation function from a stats library to compute the correct value for your list of random numbers and then use that to test that your own calculation is correct for that list.


Random Generator function
1.	Set a seed and randomly select the same value from a list


Population Sampling functions
1.	Simple random sampling
2.	Systematic sampling
3.	Confidence Interval For a Sample
4.	Margin of Error
5.	How to Find a Confidence Interval
6.	Cochranâ€™s Sample Size Formula
7.	How to Find a Sample Size Given a Confidence Interval and Width (unknown population standard deviation)
8.	How to Find a Sample Size Given a Confidence Interval and Width (known population standard deviation)


Descriptive Statistics functions
1.	**Mean**
2.	**Median**
3.	**Mode**
4.	**Variance**
5.	**Standard Deviation**
6.	**Quartiles**
7.	**Skewness**
8.	**Sample Correlation**
9.	**Population Correlation**
10.	**Z-Score**
11.	**Mean Deviation / Mean Absolute Deviation**


Additional Modules
1.	Helper Functions (Functions you use for checking types or performing repeated operations)
2.	Random Number Generator
Submission Instructions
For this project you need to submit a link to the repository on GitHub that has a build icon from Travis that shows passing.  On your Readme file, you should include your project task list and program diagram or outline.  Your readme should show the partners that worked on the project and what they did.  You can use more than one page by making additional text files and linking to them.
